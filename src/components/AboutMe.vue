          <!-- 1. Intro -->
          Hello again! üëãüèΩ<br /><br />My name‚Äôs Siddharth (Sid), and I'm thrilled
          that you have taken an interest in learning more about me. A guiding
          principle in my life, and a common theme underlying my professional
          and personal journey so far, has been to
          <span class="tintFont">‚ÄúSeek Discomfort‚Äù</span>. That is, a constant
          reminder to myself that true, holistic growth happens outside my
          comfort zone, through new challenges and ventures into the unknown.
          <br /><br />
          <!-- 2. International -->
          I stumbled across this slogan as a high-school teenager through a
          Youtube channel called ‚ÄúYes Theory‚Äù; a group of young individuals open
          to new possibilities and an unwavering quest to seek opportunities to
          fulfil their goals. Their inspiring message resonated deeply within
          me, to the extent that I embarked on a journey of higher education as
          an <span class="tintFont">international student in Canada</span>, away
          from my family, at the age of eighteen. <br /><br />
          <!-- 3. Education -->
          However, this did not diminish my inner desire to seek further
          challenges. I participated in hackathons across North America, an
          academic exchange in Europe, worked part-time at the university
          library and engaged in extracurriculars such as Habitat for Humanity
          among others during my studies. In October of 2022, I had the pleasure
          of graduating with
          <!-- eslint-disable-next-line -->
          <span class="tintFont">dean‚Äôs honors in a dual degree program</span>
          with a Bachelor of Computer Science (University of Waterloo) and a
          Bachelor of Business Administration (Wilfrid Laurier University).<br /><br />
          <!-- 4. Experiences -->
          Through my education, I got numerous co-operative (internship) work
          experiences to explore roles ranging from
          <!-- eslint-disable-next-line -->
          <span class="tintFont">software engineering to product management</span> 
          at companies of varying locations, industries and stages of growth.
          Currently, I am honing my craft at an ed-tech company, working on
          <span class="tintFont">AI-powered workforce systems</span>‚Äìat the
          intersection of technology and societal impact‚Äìfocused on empowering
          individuals and organisations to thrive in a rapidly digital
          environment. <br /><br />
          <!-- 5. Extracurricular -->
          Outside of school and work, I enjoy hiking, playing soccer, exploring
          new cities, going on unplanned adventures and meeting new people.
          <br /><br />
          <!-- 6. Outro -->
          With a strong desire to contribute to the greater social good, I'm
          <!-- eslint-disable-next-line -->
          currently <span class="tintFont">seeking new projects and opportunities</span>
          with an aligned goal of creating
          <!-- eslint-disable-next-line -->
          <span class="tintFont">long-term, positive societal impact</span>.
