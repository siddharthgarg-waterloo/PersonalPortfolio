These opportunities have allowed me to refine my leadership and technical skills while working on a product currently in market.\n\nAs a software engineer, I am constantly looking for new challenges to push me outside my comfort zone, as I believe that we stop growing once we are unwilling to have new experiences.\n\nOutside of school and work, I love exploring new cities, going on unplanned adventures, watching soccer and trying new food. Feel free to send me a message and say hi :)"
