This manifests in me seeking both professional and personal opportunities that push me outside my comfort zone. I truly believe that we stop growing once we are unwilling to have new experiences.\n\nCurrently I am studying a dual degree in Computer Science and Business at two different universities (University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University respectively).\n\nAt my previous internships, I was given the opportunity to explore the field of mobile development in collaborative and fast paced environments. These opportunities allowed me to refine my leadership and creative skills while working on a product currently in market.\n\nOutside school and work, I love exploring new cities, trying new food, going on unplanned adventures and watching soccer."
